# React Audio Player App

This is a simple React application that allows users to upload audio files, create a playlist, and play the audio files using the standard built-in HTML audio player.

## Features

- User can upload audio files (e.g., mp3) or add YouTube URLs to the playlist.
- Playlist is stored using the browser's local storage.
- Users can play any file from the playlist, and playback continues to the next file upon completion.
- The last playing audio file is remembered, and playback continues from the last position on page reload.
